Game Design 2022

These are the files for my game that I made as a final project for this course. This was meant to be a group project taking 3 weeks; however, due to a combination of technical difficulties and poor communication, I wound up doing everything by myself in 4 days. This is also the first game I've ever made in my life. The result is not very technically polished or, frankly, very good, but it is playable, and I made it, and I think that counts for something.

The goal is to move the player character (a mailman) through the maze of package thieves and mean dogs to get to the door to the next level to deliver the mail. Use the A, D, and space keys to move and left click to smack the enemies. 

I cannot stress enough that this game sucks, but in a way that people have told me is hilarious, and the comedy of its overwhelming shittiness makes me hesitant to update or remake it. This is just to show that I know how to code.
